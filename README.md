# Convolutional Neural Networks applied to Facial Expression Recognition
This project use Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge), aka FER2013, from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to train, validate and test the model created.

Some data has to be on Google Drive, because Github limit size of files. But this are available in this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jwjGKfXJYk3tGeyBw_1jpC27fBSIwFuF?usp=sharing). 

*Obs.: Folders from Google Drive has to be in root of this repository to all work.*
